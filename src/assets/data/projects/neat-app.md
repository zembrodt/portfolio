**Currently a work in progress**

A web app for users to search and rate different whiskeys.

Current work done as a Golang backend REST API for manipulating the data needed in the app
on the whiskeys. User authentication is done through this server as well.

An Angular app is currently in development to work with this API to build **Neat App**.

Final product will allow users to search for different whiskeys on various properties such as
the origin, mash bill, tasting notes, etc. Users can also view the reviews and ratings of other users as well.
Lastly, a key component to this app is for the ability of bars and retail stores to add what whiskeys they have in stock.
This can help users find what nearby bars have a whiskey they are interested in trying.
